# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
The code might not be the exact one I wrote in the heat of the moment. I am building a utility library as I proceed in the advent, so I might try to extract a few concepts into the library.
Also, most of the times I alter the code for the first task in-place to solve the second task. In the committed code, I provide both solutions as separate methods.

I took inspiration from  [this post by mcpower](https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661) for the template and the utility library.
